Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of
the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
printer took a galley of type and scrambled
it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also
the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
Lorem Ipsum passages,
and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</pre>

It is a long established fact that a reader will be
distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a 
more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use
Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
Various versions have evolved over the years,
sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
(injected humour and the like).</pre>
